README: Terminal Battleship Game with Signals

Battleship is a classic game where two players strategically place their ships on a grid and take turns guessing each other's ship positions to sink them. In this terminal version of Battleship, players communicate using signals, specifically SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2.
